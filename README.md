# Class-imbalance-and-distributional-overlap-
This project develops a machine learning framework for credit card fraud detection, addressing severe class imbalance and overlap. Using resampling methods (SMOTE, ADASYN, etc.) with ensemble models (XGBoost, Balanced RF), it applies preprocessing, tuning, and visualization. Hybrid approaches achieved superior F1 and AUC, enhancing fraud detection.
